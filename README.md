# 🗽 EDA: New York City Airbnb Listings

Welcome to another entry in my data science portfolio — an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the [NYC Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) dataset from Kaggle.

The goal of this project was to explore trends, pricing behavior, and neighborhood patterns in NYC’s Airbnb listings, and to develop insights into **what drives listing popularity and price** in different boroughs. This was also inspired by my desire to get into the space of Airbnb investing, so learning how to handle data like this will help me greatly later on when I need to conduct market research.

## 🔍 Key Insights From This Project

• **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn** dominate the Airbnb scene, with the highest number of listings and the highest prices.  
• The most expensive neighborhoods include **Tribeca**, **SoHo**, and parts of **Williamsburg**.  
• **Entire homes/apartments** are most common and most expensive, but **private rooms** offer more affordability and are highly rated.  
• There is a **strong seasonal effect** — prices and availability fluctuate by month.  
• Listings with more reviews tend to be lower-priced and located in **Brooklyn** or **Queens**.  

This project demonstrates my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and analysis, and my ability to tell a compelling story with real-world data.
